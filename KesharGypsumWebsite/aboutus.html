           <p>Our plaster boards offer superior solutions for walls, ceilings, lift shafts, stairwells, and corridors in buildings as diverse as residential, schools, hospitals, offices, cinemas, and hotels.</p>

           <h3><b>Metal framings</b></h3>
           <p> Metal Framings are an integral part of the drywall or
            ceiling system and serve as a
            backbone for them.
            </p>
           <p>A drywall or false ceiling system has a strong spine of GI metal framework with plasterboard as its face.
            The metal framework gives the system its strength, long life, and enhanced performance.
            Any compromise on the quality of the metal components can lead to
            permanent system failure.</p>

            <p>Apart from being the backbone, metals add value to the systems in many ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire Safety</li>
                <li>Acoustic Comfort</li>
                <li>Technical Excellence</li>
                <li>Uniqueness & Design</li>
            </ul>
           
           
           <h3><b>Jointing compounds</b></h3>
           <p>Jointing and finishing is the process through which gypsum Board's systems are transformed into smooth, structurally sound walls and ceilings. This process eventually determines the look of the interiors. </p>
           <p>Traditionally, the quality of a surface has been judged subjectively, with the use of phrases such as “ready-for-painting”, “ready-for-covering” and so on. However, these are not suitable for describing the level of finish. A “finished” and “ready-for-painting” surface for one person may be a sub-standard one for another.</p>
           <p>The quality of finish of gypsum board is defined by the Euro Gypsum standards (based on EN 13963). The level of finish is affected by the dimensional tolerances of boards, metal framings and level of workmanship. The flatness of the Drywall and Ceiling also impact the level of finish.</p>
           
           <h3><b>Gypsum Plasters</b></h3>
           <p> Gypsum plastering is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional sand-cement application for internal plastering surfaces.
            Gypsum plastering is also a faster application method for internal surfaces, since it does not require time consuming water curing process. Water curing process is mandatory for 20 – 21 days after sand-cement plastering to reduce shrinkage cracks arising due to heat of hydration.
            </p>
           <p>Gypsum plaster is mixed with clean water in recommended proportion at site to make a consistent slurry. Gypsum plaster slurry is then applied at desired thickness on walls and ceilings by trained applicators, this process is called as Gypsum plastering.</p>
